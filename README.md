I’m Badreddine Abourial, a DevOps Engineer who loves automating all the things! 🚀 When I’m not wrangling cloud infrastructure or building CI/CD pipelines, you can find me watching anime, reading manga, or scoring goals in football (in my dreams, at least 😄).

🌟 About Me
<img height="400" width="500" alt="GIF" align="right" src="https://c.tenor.com/J-WqNV4NKXEAAAAM/anime-luffy.gif">
💼 DevOps Engineer by day, cloud automation ninja by night.
📚 Currently mastering the art of Kubernetes, Terraform, and promising myself I’ll finish that Udemy course.
🤝 Open to collaborations on DevOps projects, or even just talking about the best way to automate coffee-making ☕.
🧑‍💻 Check out my GitHub – it's not just a repository; it’s a journey.
📫 Want to talk? Shoot me an email: developerbadreddine@gmail.com.
⚡ Fun fact: I believe there’s nothing a good YAML file can’t fix...except maybe a broken heart. 💔
🛠️ Tools & Tech That I Tame:
Cloud & Infrastructure
🛡️ Kubernetes and Docker (Containers for days!).
☁️ Google Cloud Platform – still waiting for that perfect cloud.
📦 Helm, Rancher, and ArgoCD (GitOps, because manual deployments are sooo last decade).
CI/CD & Version Control
🚀 Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions – automation is life.
🔧 Git, Gitea – pushing code and hoping it works.
Infrastructure as Code & Configuration Management
💡 Terraform – turning infrastructure into code magic.
Monitoring & Logging
👁️ Grafana, Prometheus, ELK Stack – because someone’s gotta keep an eye on things.
💻 Dynatrace – for when things go south... fast.
Security & Compliance
🔐 Vault HashiCorp – hiding secrets like a pro.
🛡️ Sonarqube, OWASP ZAP – keeping those vulnerabilities at bay.
Programming Languages
🐍 Python – because it’s not a real tool unless there's a Python script for it.
⚙️ JavaScript/TypeScript – for all your frontend/backend/middle-of-nowhere needs.
🎉 Hobbies & Fun Stuff
Coding Addict: Because sleep is for the weak.
Anime & Manga: Still waiting for my life to turn into a shonen anime...
Football: Amateur legend. Neighbors call me the “next big thing”... in their group chat.
Gym Enthusiast: Trying to lift heavy things and put them back down, all while pretending I know what I'm doing.
