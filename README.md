I’m **Badreddine Abourial**, a DevOps Engineer who loves automating all the things! 🚀 When I’m not wrangling cloud infrastructure or building CI/CD pipelines, you can find me watching anime, reading manga, or scoring goals in football (in my dreams, at least 😄).

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech That I Tame:

### **Cloud & Infrastructure**
- 🛡️ **Kubernetes** and **Docker** (Containers for days!).  
- ☁️ **Google Cloud Platform** – still waiting for that perfect cloud.  
- 📦 **Helm**, **Rancher**, and **ArgoCD** (GitOps, because manual deployments are sooo last decade).  

### **CI/CD & Version Control**
- 🚀 **Jenkins**, **GitLab CI**, **GitHub Actions** – automation is life.  
- 🔧 **Git**, **Gitea** – pushing code and hoping it works.

### **Infrastructure as Code & Configuration Management**
- 💡 **Terraform** – turning infrastructure into **code magic**.  

### **Monitoring & Logging**
- 👁️ **Grafana**, **Prometheus**, **ELK Stack** – because someone’s gotta keep an eye on things.  
- 💻 **Dynatrace** – for when things go south... fast.

### **Security & Compliance**
- 🔐 **Vault HashiCorp** – hiding secrets like a pro.  
- 🛡️ **Sonarqube**, **OWASP ZAP** – keeping those vulnerabilities at bay.

### **Programming Languages**
- 🐍 **Python** – because it’s not a real tool unless there's a Python script for it.  
- ⚙️ **JavaScript/TypeScript** – for all your frontend/backend/middle-of-nowhere needs.

## 🎉 Hobbies & Fun Stuff

- **Coding Addict**: Because sleep is for the weak.  
- **Anime & Manga**: Still waiting for my life to turn into a shonen anime...  
- **Football**: Amateur legend. Neighbors call me the **“next big thing”**... in their group chat.  
- **Gym Enthusiast**: Trying to lift heavy things and put them back down, all while pretending I know what I'm doing.
